# Guide on Debugging and Troubleshooting

## "Triage"

When you are stuck, take the time to document the issue after you have unsuccessfully worked on it for some [time unit].
- Another person can see the problem, who has already experienced it.
- It's not about skills or not living up to the standards, but time transparency. Delays are normal, but if they are not communicated clearly, they upset people.
- Helps to plan future iterations/sprints more realistically
- Don't be afraid to open a "stupid sounding" issue. Mistakes or knowledge gaps are normal and only if you ask, you learn from them.
